Community Legal Services MLP Outcomes Report
===========================================

This was originally taken from a complicated spreadsheet created by Michael Bowen, CLS's then director of IT.  
This has been translated into R for readability, updatability, etc... by Michael Hollander and Nate Vogel.

The report reads through two Legal Server reports, one on cases and one on outreaches for our MLP, and summarizes the data.

The basic functionality of reading the reports and summarizing the data is done by mlp_outcomes.R.  The main work of displaying is done through Shiny.  This is the first project that we've done using R and Shiny, so there is probably a lot of room for improvement.
